// Several Scores with Validation
// By Neilor Tonin, URI  Brazil

// Timelimit: 1
// Write an program to read two scores of a student. Calculate and print the semester average. The program must accept only valid scores (a score must fit in the range [0.10]). Each score must be validated separately.

// The program must print a message "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)" that means "new calculate (1-yes 2-no)". After, the input will be (1 or 2). 1 means a new calculation, 2 means that the execution must be finished.

// Input
// The input file contains several positive or negative floating-point (double) valuesâ€‹. After the input of 2 valid scores, an integer number X will be read. Your program must stop when X = 2.

// Output
// If an invalid score is read, must be printed the message "nota invalida". When two valid scores are read, the message "media = " must be printed folowed by the average between these 2 scores. The message "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)" must be printed after reading X. This message should be displayed again if the standard input number for X is less than 1 or greater than 2, as example below.

// The output average must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

$valid = [];
while(true) {
    $x = trim(fgets(STDIN));

    if($x >= 0 && $x <= 10) {
        $valid[] = $x;
        if(count($valid) == 2) {
            $media = ($valid[0]+$valid[1])/2;
            $media = sprintf('%.2f', $media);
            echo "media = $media\n";

            while(true) {
                echo "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)\n";
                $y = trim(fgets(STDIN));

                if($y == 1) {
                    array_splice($valid, 0);
                    break;
                } elseif($y == 2) {
                    break 2;
                }
            }
        }
    } else {
        echo "nota invalida\n";
    }
